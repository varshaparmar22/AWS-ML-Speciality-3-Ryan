@@@ difference between DL and ML

their technique of extracting features 
- DL will do it automatically you have to choose only architecture that you want and pass data FE will done automatically
- ML choose model to train and extract feature manually

@@@ Structured data
- data which are structured and can be stored in DB

@@@ unstructured data
- images, newspaper data , email data - diff kind of data together

@@@ database
- MySQL, aurora many

@@@ data warehouse
- multiple structured database storage warehouse

@@@ Amazon Fargate
- you can run ECS  container without managing server with fargate
- its a compute engine

@@@ datalake
- mixture repository for structured and unstructured data
- file, text, mL output, real-time data, analytics output any kind of data

@@@ Aurora - RDS
- MySQL and PostgreSQL- many options given to choose to create database  - relation data storage - managed by AWS 
- no need to worry about hardware provision, backup and setup

@@@ RedShift
- data warehouse
- parallel, querying
- column storage, data compression
- use ML to optimize its performance
- perform analytics

@@@ DynamoDB
- no sql, key-value db
- minimum latency(delay of transfer)
- very fast response
- 3 AZ replication

@@@ S3
- you can create your own data-lake
- object tags are important for user access, life cycle rule, performing analytics
- EC2 instance can be launched to access data from S3

@@@ SSE-S3 encryption
- two level security 
- 1.encrypt object by key
- 2.encrypt key by master key

@@@ Amazon Macie
- security service
- automatically find sensitive data and alert user about anomalies

@@@ Amazon s3 access log <= monitoring system
- log all access request made to bucket
- ensure security and access audit

@@@ Amazon Trusted advisor
- recommendation to improve system performance
- close security gap

@@@ Security S3
- add tagging with bucket policy like tag : Sensitive = TRUE

@@@ Elastic Search
- for clickstream analytics

@@@ Amazon Elasticache
- in-memory, data store and cache
- gaming, IOT, healthcare app
- retrive from high throughput, low latency in memory datastore



@@@ KDS - Kinesis data stream
- provide KDS enabled data encryption
- scale data accordingly
- so data analytics can be applied directly on those data
- shard have partitions, data and code associated with each shard - shard = multiple partition
- KDS has KPL & KCL - (producer and client) library
- you can use to configure producer and client related application development task
- direct kinesis sdk api provided by aws which is more faster than library - low latency

@@@ KFS
- consume data from any device
- do processing by lambda func
- deliver it to any datasource
